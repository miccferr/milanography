Milanography
============

# What
Shameless adaptation of the great [Bostonography](http://bostonography.com/neighborhoods/) project to *la cità la pusee bèla ad mùnd*.  

# When
Soon.  
~But let's try first to start with a simpler site like [this](http://www.cityplanner.it/experiment_host/php/ol3_draw_save/draw-feature_mod1.php).~  
Update! Completed porting from PJ's website.  
Next goal: Flask + SQLite
# Why
Why not?

# How
Probably GeoDjango and some Leaflet wizardy.
