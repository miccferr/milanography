Milanography
============

# What
Shameless adaptation of the great [Bostonography](http://bostonography.com/neighborhoods/) project to *la cità la pusee bèla ad mùnd* (A.K.A. Milan).  

# When
Soon.  
~~But let's try first to start with a simpler site like [this](http://www.cityplanner.it/experiment_host/php/ol3_draw_save/draw-feature_mod1.php).~~  
Update! Completed porting from PJ's website.  
Next goal:    

- ~~Flask + SQLite~~
- Flask + Postgres (via SQLAlchemy) ,es [1](http://blog.y3xz.com/blog/2012/08/16/flask-and-postgresql-on-heroku), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD0p-opdyoE) **NEW:** take a look at [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9901082/what-is-this-javascript-require) script  
- Set default brushes panel to exactly one polygon per category (every neighborhood is a catergory)  
- Set default polygon brush tool to draw just one and only one shape for each neighborhood. But allow shape modification. 


# Why
Why not?

# How
Probably ~~GeoDjango~~ Flask + Postgres and some Leaflet wizardy.
